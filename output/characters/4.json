  "sayings": [
    "Bender! Stop killing for a minute!",
    "Because your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee!",
    "Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used, like the death ray. ",
    "Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window. Darn, I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake!",
    "Just 'cause I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me!",
    "Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.",
    "Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! I suppose I could part with one and still be feared\u2026",
    "Everybody out of the conference room! I'm calling a conference!",
    "Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be...",
    "Good God! Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo!",
    "Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!",
    "Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!",
    "I am calling a mandatory company meeting. To the mandatorium!",
    "I can wire anything directly into anything - I'm the professor!",
    "I'm sciencing as fast as I can!",
    "I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!",
    "Less invasions, more equations!",
    "Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about.",
    "Now I've often said 'Good news' when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.",
    "Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.",
    "Of course Fry, show me where on this anatomically correct doll where he touched you.",
    "Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.",
    "Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here you'll really be dead. But instead of science we believe in crazy hocus pocus. It's sort of like Kansas.",
    "Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?",
    "Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.",
    "Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.",
    "That proves nothing! And furthermore, you'd think I could remember a thing like that; plus, who are you anyway?",
    "There's just one little problem, and it's a big one.",
    "There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!",
    "To better understand the anomaly, I will test its effects on this Giant Medium-Sized Ant.",
    "Well, then good news! It's a suppository.",
    "Who did this? Answer now or be punished.",
    "Yes, it's the apocalypse all right. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.",
    "Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable!"
